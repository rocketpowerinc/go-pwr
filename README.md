## ‚ú® Overview

**`go-pwr`** is a cross-platform launcher for your personal automation scripts. Built with Go and powered by [Charm's](https://github.com/charmbracelet) [Bubble Tea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), it delivers a sleek, interactive TUI for browsing, previewing, and running bash and powershell scripts across Windows, macOS, Linux, and server environments.

Features beautiful syntax highlighting for script previews (when `bat` is installed), tag-based script search functionality. It automatically clones the "scriptbin" repository to `$HOME/Downloads/Temp/scriptbin`, providing a centralized location for script access and management that's easily accessible and always up to date with the latest scripts.

## üîß Repository Setup

**`go-pwr`** uses RocketPowerInc's scriptbin by default, but you can configure it to use your own custom script repository while keeping the default as a fallback option.

**Quick Commands:**

- `-h`, `-help` - Show help message with all available flags
- `-v`, `-version` - Show version information and build details
  - FYI the "Git commit" and the "Build date" fields will only show if the app is built from source (Very good for when I and developing the app)
- View current repository: `go-pwr -show-repo`
- Set custom repository: `go-pwr -set-repo https://github.com/yourusername/your-scripts.git`
- Reset to default: `go-pwr -reset-repo`

For detailed setup instructions, repository requirements, and troubleshooting, see **[Repository Setup Guide](REPOSITORY_SETUP.md)**.

## üîç Tag-Based Search

**`go-pwr`** includes powerful tag-based search functionality to help you quickly find the right scripts for your needs. Scripts can be tagged with:

**Usage:**

- Press `Ctrl+F` to activate search mode
- Type multiple tags separated by spaces (e.g., `bash linux ubuntu`)
- Search results update in real-time as you type
- Press `Enter` to apply search or `Escape` to cancel
- Press `Escape` again to clear search and show all scripts

## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging Your Scripts

To make your scripts searchable, add tags at the top of your script files using this format:

### Bash/Shell Scripts (.sh)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

#*Tags:
# Languages: bash zsh
# Platforms: Linux Mac WSL
# Distros: Ubuntu Debian
# Categories: utility development
# PackageManagers: apt brew
# Privilege: Admin User

# Your script content here...
```

### PowerShell Scripts (.ps1)

```powershell
#! Description: Your script description

#*Tags:
# Languages: pwsh powershell
# Platforms: Windows
# Categories: utility demo
# PackageManagers: winget chocolatey
# Privilege: Admin User

# Your script content here...
```

**Tagging Guidelines:**

- Start the tags section with `#*Tags:` on its own line
- Each category starts with `# CategoryName:` followed by space-separated tags
- Use lowercase for consistency (parser handles case-insensitivity)
- Common categories: `Languages`, `Platforms`, `Distros`, `Categories`, `PackageManagers`, `DesktopEnvironments`, `Architectures`
- Add as many or as few tags as appropriate for your script

## üîÑ Recursive vs Directory Mode

**`go-pwr`** supports two viewing modes:

- **Directory Mode** (default): Browse scripts folder by folder, just like a file manager
- **Recursive Mode**: Search and view ALL scripts from all subdirectories at once

**Toggle between modes:**

- Press `Ctrl+R` to switch between Directory and Recursive modes
- In **Recursive Mode**:
  - See all scripts from every subdirectory in one list
  - Perfect for searching across your entire script collection
  - Directory navigation is disabled (no need to browse folders)
  - Scripts show their relative path from the root
- In **Directory Mode**:
  - Browse one folder at a time
  - Use arrow keys to navigate into/out of directories
  - Traditional file manager experience
