# Go-PWR Application

## ‚ú® Overview

**`go-pwr`** is a cross-platform launcher for your personal automation scripts. Built with Go and powered by [Charm's](https://github.com/charmbracelet) [Bubble Tea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), it delivers a sleek, interactive TUI for browsing, previewing, and running bash and powershell scripts across Windows, macOS, Linux, and server environments.

Features beautiful syntax highlighting for script previews (when `bat` is installed), tag-based script search functionality. It automatically clones the "scriptbin" repository to `$HOME/Downloads/Temp/scriptbin`, providing a centralized location for script access and management that's easily accessible and always up to date with the latest scripts.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$gooAlias = @"
function goo {
    Remove-Item -Recurse -Force go-pwr -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Remove-Item -Force `"$HOME\\go\\bin\\go-pwr.exe`" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    git clone https://github.com/rocketpowerinc/go-pwr.git

# Alias to reinstall go-pwr
alias goo='
    rm -rf go-pwr && \
    rm -f ~/go/bin/go-pwr && \
    git clone https://github.com/rocketpowerinc/go-pwr.git && \
    cd go-pwr && \

# Alias to reinstall go-pwr
alias goo='
  rm -rf go-pwr && \\
  rm -f ~/go/bin/go-pwr && \\
  git clone https://github.com/rocketpowerinc/go-pwr.git && \\
  cd go-pwr && \\

## üêû Known Issues / Bugs

- ‚ö†Ô∏è macOS default Terminal has issues with borders/syntax in `gum`; use **iTerm2** instead

### üé® Syntax Highlighting

`go-pwr` automatically provides beautiful syntax highlighting in script previews using [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) when available. **If `bat` is not installed, the application gracefully falls back to plain text previews with helpful installation instructions.**

**Optional: Install `bat` for enhanced syntax highlighting:**

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  winget install sharkdp.bat
  ```

- **macOS:**
  ```bash
  brew install bat
  ```

- **Ubuntu/Debian:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install bat
  ```
  *Note: On Ubuntu, the command is known as `batcat` but `go-pwr` automatically detects this.*

---
### üîç Tag-Based Search

**`go-pwr`** includes powerful tag-based search functionality to help you quickly find the right scripts for your needs. Scripts can be tagged with:

**Usage:**
- Press `Ctrl+F` to activate search mode
- Type multiple tags separated by spaces (e.g., `bash linux ubuntu`)
- Search results update in real-time as you type
- Press `Enter` to apply search or `Escape` to cancel
- Press `Escape` again to clear search and show all scripts


## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging Your Scripts

To make your scripts searchable, add tags at the top of your script files using this format:

### Bash/Shell Scripts (.sh)
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

#*Tags:
# Languages: bash zsh
# Platforms: Linux Mac WSL
# Distros: Ubuntu Debian
# Categories: utility development
# PackageManagers: apt brew

# Your script content here...
```

### PowerShell Scripts (.ps1)
```powershell
#! ADMIN NOT REQUIRED
#! Description: Your script description

#*Tags:
# Languages: pwsh powershell
# Platforms: Windows
# Categories: utility demo
# PackageManagers: winget chocolatey

# Your script content here...
```

**Tagging Guidelines:**
- Start the tags section with `#*Tags:` on its own line
- Each category starts with `# CategoryName:` followed by space-separated tags
- Use lowercase for consistency (parser handles case-insensitivity)
- Common categories: `Languages`, `Platforms`, `Distros`, `Categories`, `PackageManagers`, `DesktopEnvironments`, `Architectures`
- Add as many or as few tags as appropriate for your script


## üîÑ Recursive vs Directory Mode

**`go-pwr`** supports two viewing modes:

- **Directory Mode** (default): Browse scripts folder by folder, just like a file manager
- **Recursive Mode**: Search and view ALL scripts from all subdirectories at once

**Toggle between modes:**
- Press `Ctrl+R` to switch between Directory and Recursive modes
- In **Recursive Mode**:
  - See all scripts from every subdirectory in one list
  - Perfect for searching across your entire script collection
  - Directory navigation is disabled (no need to browse folders)
  - Scripts show their relative path from the root
- In **Directory Mode**:
  - Browse one folder at a time
  - Use arrow keys to navigate into/out of directories
  - Traditional file manager experience
