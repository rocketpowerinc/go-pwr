# Release Notes v1.0.6

## üîß Fixes

### Go Module Checksum Issue Resolution

- **Fixed:** Resolved Go module checksum mismatch error that prevented installation via `go install`
- **Issue:** The v1.0.5 tag was modified after publication, causing Go's checksum database to reject the module
- **Solution:** Created new immutable v1.0.6 tag to restore proper module installation

### What was the problem?

Users encountered this error when trying to install:

```
go: github.com/rocketpowerinc/go-pwr@v1.0.5: verifying module: checksum mismatch
        downloaded: h1:6usfd4+VfVqEcU6ZbGRIROb1KveHsvyzh0YB++O6eCw=

SECURITY ERROR
This download does NOT match the one reported by the checksum server.
```

### How it's fixed

- Created v1.0.6 as a clean, immutable tag
- Go's checksum database will now properly verify this version
- Installation via `go install` works correctly again
